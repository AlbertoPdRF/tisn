# Back end of Tisn

The back end is currently hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). To deploy changes, execute `git subtree push --prefix api -f heroku master` from the root directory.

The database is currently hosted on [mongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/), and is the same one as used during development.
